## Hello dave!
- Build status can be found here: https://travis-ci.org/julienbrunuk/hello-dave
- A live deployed version is automatically deployed there: https://julienbrunuk.github.io/hello-dave
### Local setup
- Install nodejs and yarn, then run `yarn start` to run a local development server
- You can run the tests with the command `yarn test`
- You can build the project locally with the command `yarn build`

### Other libraries
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- I used [Evergreen](http://evergreen.surge.sh/) to get something that looks decent relatively quickly

### Observations
- A sample test file can be found in `validators/index.test.js`

### If I had more time..
- I would write more tests!
- I would separate components from containers
- I would use a better state management system such as redux
- I would add a language switcher


I hope you like this code sample, I am free to answer any questions you might have
